              <strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS</strong>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>
                  We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. All
                  changes are effective immediately upon posting on the Resource
                  Watch website. You should review these terms regularly for
                  changes. Your continued use of the Services after any such
                  changes constitutes Your binding acceptance of the updated
                  Terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., excluding New
                  York's conflict of laws provisions, apply to any dispute
                  about the Services, their content or these Terms. The U.N.
                  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
                  doesn't apply. If we have a disagreement related to these
                  Terms, or Your or Our performance under them that we cannot
                  resolve between us, then we agree to have them finally
                  resolved in arbitration using either (i) the International
                  Arbitration Rules of the International Dispute Resolution
                  Centre of the American Arbitration Association, if You are
                  located outside of the United States, or (ii) the Commercial
                  Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, if
                  You are located in the United States.  We agree to follow this
                  paragraph if it differs from those rules.  There will be only
                  one arbitrator if our disagreement involves less than
                  $250,000.  If our disagreement involves more than $250,000,
                  then we each appoint one arbitrator, and those two
                  arbitrators choose a third.  We agree that the arbitrators
                  will not have the power to award either of us any damages
                  that are not consistent with Section 5 (Disclaimers and
                  Limitations) of these Terms. The arbitration will be in
                  Washington, DC, USA, and will be conducted in English.
                  Unless we agree or one of us shows its essential, there will
                  not be any formal discovery in our arbitration.  The
                  arbitrators can award costs and attorney’s fees against one
                  of us, or divide them between us.  We understand that any
                  court with jurisdiction will enforce the decisions from
                  the arbitration and enter judgment on them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If We do not promptly enforce the Terms, We have not given up
                  any other rights or the right to enforce them or other Terms
                  in the future.

                  If any particular provision of these Terms is not enforceable,
                  that doesn't affect the enforceability of any other provision
                  of the Terms.
