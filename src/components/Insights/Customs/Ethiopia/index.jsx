                <p>Agricultural growth depends on the ability of Ethiopia’s farmers to maintain productive crops using subsistence farming, leaving them exceptionally dependent on rainfall. Farming processes and smallholder farmers are highly sensitive to climate changes.</p>
                <p>Ethiopia’s two grain growing seasons are belg and meher. Belg is the shorter season from February to April, and meher is the main season from May to September.  Grain production (including mainly corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, and teff) greatly depends on rainfall patterns during the belg season. Some years see changes in onset and completion of growing seasons, which impact crop production and quality.</p>
                <p>The landlocked country of Ethiopia also faces problematic issues related to its geographical location, which are further exacerbated by climate change. It contains two agricultural regions, the lowlands and the highlands, which are prone to higher temperatures, prolonged droughts, precipitation variations, soil erosion, and desertification. Most of Ethiopia’s livestock grazing land is found in the lowlands, and most of the subsistence farms are found in the highlands.</p>

                <p>The map bellow shows an overview of CHIRPS rainfall data and eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 2015 averaged over the Tigray region. NDVI is a common measurement of greenness in live vegetation, and is often used as a proxy for vegetation amounts, health and productivity.  Figure 4 is a typical example of how NDVI can be used to learn about the vegetation differences in an area from year to year.  Positive changes from 2014 to 2015 are shown in green areas, whereas the decreases in vegetation amounts are shown in brown areas.  Given that the rainfall over a region is the most important input to the vegetation amount and health, it is natural that the two will show a strong correlation. Furthermore, scientific literature shows that the vegetation amount has a strong correlation with the crop yields.</p>

                <p>This study highlights the relationship between NDVI and rainfall, and enables researchers to link patterns of rainfall with their effects in terms of vegetation health. Decreases in both precipitation and vegetation health indicate possible ongoing drought conditions and negative effects for grain setting and production during the growing season.  By knowing this relationship and comparing NDVI between the current year and previous years, researchers can begin to forecast threats to overall grain productivity for a region, even before yields are actually recorded on the ground. A correlation between rainfall and NDVI is apparent in the charts below. As the rainfall amount increases, NDVI also increases, which indicates opportunities for agricultural growth.</p>

                <p>In this case, cumulative NMME-forecasted precipitation for mid-September to mid-October 2016 was compared to CHIRPS-recorded precipitation for the same monthly period for each of the years during 2000-2015.  The results were color coded to easily identify areas that fell into the highest (green), mid (yellow), and low (red) terciles for cumulative rainfall for this period.  One region, Gambela, located in western Ethiopia and shown in red in the map, was found to be at risk and in the bottom 6% of average seasonal rainfall over the past 17 years.  The lack of rainfall overall during this period is important from a general planning perspective, but of additional interest is whether there are any notable trends occurring on a daily level.</p>
                <p>The “High, Medium and Low terciles for forecasted 2016 grainsetting seasonal precipitation compared to 17-year historical data” picture takes a closer look at the daily data, during past mid-September to mid-October in the Gambela region, and several general trends become apparent.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First, forecasted precipitation peaks for 2016 are not as great as in past years.</li>
                  <li>Second, the general trend is for less cumulative rainfall on a daily basis over most of the entire period.</li>
                  <li>Third, and perhaps most importantly, the forecast model calls for a dry period in the first week or more of October, a grain-setting period in which sufficient precipitation is vitally important for overall crop yields.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Similar analysis can be performed for a monthly total, and with all the ensemble members of the NMME dataset, and a potentially similar structure will appear. The critical point of this analysis is that such information can be used to reach out to farmers in this region and commence planning for the effects of a potential drought on belg grain production in Gambela.</p>
