            World Resources Institute respects the privacy of our visitors and 
            users and recognizes the importance of protecting the information we 
            collect about you.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy tells you how World Resources Institute ("WRI," 
            "we," or "us") handles information collected about you through our 
            websites and applications (collectively, the “Services”). By using 
            our websites or by providing information to us through the Services, 
            you agree to the collection and use of such information as described 
            in this Privacy Policy.

          <p>
            WRI is a global research organization that spans more than 50 countries, 
            with offices in the United States, China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and 
            more.  As a result, information that we collect through the Services, 
            including personal information, may be transferred to our U.S. offices 
            to permit us to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, to 
            provide information and services, and to perform related business activities. 
            In addition, we may work with third-party service providers in the United 
            States and in other countries to support our business activities. Thus, 
            personal information may be transferred to, stored on servers in, and 
            accessed from the United States and countries other than the country in 
            which the information was initially collected. In all such instances, 
            we use, transfer, and disclose personal information solely for the purposes 
            described in this Privacy Policy. 
          </p>
